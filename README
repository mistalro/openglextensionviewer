Introduction
------------

This application is intended to be an aid for OpenGL developers wanting
to keep up with the latest changes to the OpenGL API and hardware. It
provides the following features:

	o Display of available video modes of the hardware
	o Display of available drawable surfaces
	o Automatic downloading of registry header files
	o Automatic downloading of registry extension specifications
	o Analysis of available OpenGL extensions
	o Reading of registry header files to generate source code used
	  to find the location of OpenGL extension functions

Build instructions
------------------

In the directory where this README file is located, type the command:

	make 

This will compile all code in the subdirectories followed by the application
itself.


Running instructions
--------------------

Enter the directory "viewer" and there will be an executable called "viewer".

Running this executable will start up the Qt application.

Required directories
--------------------

The application will create the directory "registry" and will place a copy
of the OpenGL registry in here as well as the four current GL header files:

        glext.h 
	glxext.h 
	wglext.h
	glcorearb.h

Layout
------

The application source code is organised into the following units:

	viewer	- The Qt application source code
	libextviewer - Low level source code used
	filesysascii - ASCII file reading routines
	LICENSE - GNU public license
	README - This file
